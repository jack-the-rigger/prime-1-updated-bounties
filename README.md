# prime-1-updated-bounties


all runs must include video and some form of commentary (i want to hear winners reactions), 

face cam and controller cam not required.
 
this is so that anyone can participate with ought fear of revealing there identity while making the run

interesting for potential new runners watching. i don't want another T3 video at the top of the leaderboard where 

it could be a tas and you wouldn't be able to tell. runs must be validated on speedrun.com then send a link to
